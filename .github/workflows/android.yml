    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Setup Java (JDK 17 is standard for modern Android Studio projects)
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'

      # 3. Setup Gradle with caching (Speeds up builds)
      - name: Setup Gradle
        uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v4

      # 4. Grant execute permission to gradlew
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # 5. Build the Release APK
      # This creates app-release-unsigned.apk since we aren't signing it
      - name: Build Release APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleRelease

      # 6. (Optional) Rename the APK to something nicer
      # This renames 'app-release-unsigned.apk' to 'AniFloat-release.apk'
      - name: Rename APK
        run: mv app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk app/build/outputs/apk/release/AniFloat-release.apk

      # 7. Create GitHub Release and Upload APK

          generate_release_notes: true
          make_latest: true

      # 8. Upload Artifact (For manual runs or if release step is skipped)
      # This lets you download the APK from the "Actions" tab summary even if not tagging
      - name: Upload APK Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
